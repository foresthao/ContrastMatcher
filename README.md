# ContrastMatcher: An Adaptive Dense-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Method for Provenance Graph Matching

This repository contains the code for the **ContrastMatcher** framework, as proposed in the paper *"ContrastMatcher: An Adaptive Dense-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Method for Provenance Graph Matching"*. The work focuses on using graph contrastive learning techniques to learn subgraph relations in provenance graphs for cyberattack detection.

## Abstract
The ContrastMatcher framework employs graph contrastive learning (GCL) to learn high-quality embeddings for provenance graphs, allowing for effective subgraph matching and cyberattack detection. The model utilizes various augmentation strategies to ensure robust graph representations and incorporates a combination of Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) for optimal performance.


## Code Release Plan
**We are committed to making the code publicly available upon paper publication. ** The full implementation of the **ContrastMatcher** framework, along with all necessary datasets and experiment scripts, will be shared with the community for reproducibility and further research.

## Getting Started
The code will be publicly available after the paper is published. Stay tuned for updates!
